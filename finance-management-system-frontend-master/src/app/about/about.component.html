  A personal finance management system is a digital tool designed to help
  individuals effectively manage their finances. It typically includes features
  such as expense tracking, budgeting, goal setting, and financial analysis.
  Users can input their income and expenses, categorize transactions, and
  generate reports to gain insights into their financial health. These systems
  often offer mobile apps for on-the-go access and may sync with bank accounts
  to automate data entry. The primary goal is to empower individuals to make
  informed financial decisions, save money, and achieve their financial
  objectives.
